# Blockchain-Based Ethical Sourcing Verification

A decentralized platform enabling transparent verification of ethical sourcing practices throughout global supply chains.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless ecosystem for ethical sourcing verification with the following key components:

- **Supplier Certification**: Immutable records of compliance with ethical standards
- **Audit Tracking**: Transparent documentation of independent verification processes
- **Material Chain-of-Custody**: End-to-end monitoring of components through production
- **Consumer Verification**: Accessible confirmation of ethical sourcing claims

## Smart Contracts

### Supplier Certification Contract
- Stores verifiable credentials for ethical compliance standards (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, etc.)
- Manages certification expiration and renewal processes
- Links suppliers to specific geographical locations and production facilities
- Implements multi-stakeholder validation requirements for certification changes

### Audit Tracking Contract
- Records independent verification of supplier practices and conditions
- Maintains immutable history of audit findings and remediation efforts
- Manages auditor credentials and conflict-of-interest declarations
- Enables time-stamped documentation with cryptographic proof of authenticity

### Material Chain-of-Custody Contract
- Tracks raw materials and components through each production stage
- Creates verifiable links between batches of materials and finished products
- Monitors transportation and storage conditions for sensitive goods
- Prevents unauthorized substitution or commingling of non-verified materials

### Consumer Verification Contract
- Generates scannable product identifiers linked to complete sourcing history
- Provides customizable transparency levels for different stakeholder needs
- Enables consumers to verify ethical claims through mobile applications
- Supports feedback mechanisms for reporting potential violations

## Benefits

- **Trust Building**: Verifiable evidence of ethical practices builds consumer confidence
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of compliance issues throughout the supply chain
- **Premium Justification**: Tangible proof supporting ethical sourcing price premiums
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Simplified reporting for modern slavery and ethical trade laws
- **Brand Protection**: Decreased reputation risk through transparent verification
